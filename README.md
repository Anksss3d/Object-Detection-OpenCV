# Object-Detection-OpenCV-PreTrainedModel

Object detection using OpenCV Library with pre trained model.

In this python program, I have used pre trained model for object detection. 

It can be used to detect 80 types of objects that are mentioned in coco.names file. 

It is most simple way to integrate obejct detection with video stream.

Some Samples are:
